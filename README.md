1. export your tweets. [twitter has instructions](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive)
2. put it in a new folder and unzip your tweets. (i have to fix this)
3. there's a tweets.js file in this folder. make sure you know where it is.
4. in `archive_nav.py`, put the full file path to that tweets.js as the value of FILENAME.
5. run `./run.sh`. don't be on windows. (or maybe bash subsystem stuff is that good now?)
6. in your console it'll tell you the URL, go visit that URL for the app
